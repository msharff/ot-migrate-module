  # Visit the URL above (relative to your site root) and look at it. You can see
  # that <response> is the outer element, and each item we want to import is a
  # <position> element. The item_selector value is the selector to use to query the
  # desired elements from the root of the data.
  item_selector: /story

  # Under 'fields', we list the data items to be imported. The first level keys
  # are the source field names we want to populate (the names to be used as
  # sources in the process configuration below). For each field we're importing,
  # we provide a label (optional - this is for display in migration tools) and
  # a selector for retrieving that value. It's important to note that this selector
  # is relative to the elements retrieved by item_selector.
  #
  # This is a pretty simple example but note that it does not manage the issues around
  # migrating hierarchical taxonomies, which is a whole other can of worms.
  fields:
    -
      name: name
      label: 'Name'
      selector: name
    -

  # Under 'ids', we identify source fields populated above which will uniquely
  # identify each imported item. The 'type' makes sure the migration map table
  # uses the proper schema type for stored the IDs.
  ids:
    # id:
    name:
      type: string

process:
  # Note that the source field names here (machine_name and friendly_name) were
  # defined by the 'fields' configuration for the source plugin above.
